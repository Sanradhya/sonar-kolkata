# Demo Video Outline - Sonar Kolkata with Kiro

**Duration**: 5 minutes  
**Objective**: Demonstrate how Kiro accelerated the development of a complex Web3 heritage application

## Video Structure

### Opening (30 seconds)
**Scene**: Project introduction with live application
- **Visual**: Sonar Kolkata application running in browser
- **Narration**: 
  > "This is Sonar Kolkata - a Web3-enabled heritage exploration app that combines interactive mapping with blockchain technology. What you're seeing took just 5.5 hours to build from scratch, thanks to Kiro AI assistant. Let me show you how."

**Key Points**:
- Show the live application with interactive map
- Highlight Web3 wallet connection
- Mention the dramatic time savings

### Segment 1: Project Setup & Architecture (1 minute)
**Scene**: Live coding session showing Kiro assistance
- **Visual**: Split screen - Kiro chat and VS Code
- **Demonstration**:
  1. Show Kiro analyzing requirements
  2. Technology stack recommendation
  3. Project structure generation
  4. TypeScript configuration setup

**Narration**:
> "Starting with just an idea - create a heritage site explorer with Web3 features. Watch how Kiro analyzes the requirements, recommends the optimal tech stack, and generates a complete project structure with TypeScript, React, and modern tooling in minutes."

**Code Examples**:
```typescript
// Show Kiro generating:
interface HeritageSite {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  coordinates: [number, number];
  // ... complete interface
}
```

### Segment 2: Web3 Integration Magic (1.5 minutes)
**Scene**: Complex Web3 setup made simple
- **Visual**: Kiro implementing wallet connectivity
- **Demonstration**:
  1. Wagmi configuration generation
  2. RainbowKit integration
  3. Multi-chain support setup
  4. Smart contract interface creation

**Narration**:
> "Web3 integration is notoriously complex. Here's Kiro setting up wallet connectivity with support for 6 different blockchain networks, MetaMask integration, and smart contract interfaces - all with proper TypeScript types and error handling."

**Live Demo**:
- Show wallet connection working
- Demonstrate network switching
- Test MetaMask integration

### Segment 3: Interactive Map Development (1 minute)
**Scene**: Building the core feature
- **Visual**: Map component creation and customization
- **Demonstration**:
  1. React Leaflet integration
  2. Heritage site data structure
  3. Marker clustering for performance
  4. Interactive popups and modals

**Narration**:
> "The heart of the application is this interactive map showing 50+ heritage sites across Kolkata. Kiro not only implemented the mapping functionality but suggested performance optimizations like marker clustering that weren't in the original requirements."

**Live Demo**:
- Navigate the interactive map
- Click on heritage sites
- Show responsive design on mobile

### Segment 4: Real-time Problem Solving (1.5 minutes)
**Scene**: Debugging MetaMask integration issues
- **Visual**: Problem identification and resolution
- **Demonstration**:
  1. MetaMask not appearing in production
  2. Kiro's systematic debugging approach
  3. Multiple solution attempts
  4. Final resolution with debug tools

**Narration**:
> "When MetaMask stopped working after deployment, Kiro didn't just fix the immediate issue. It created comprehensive debugging tools, multiple fallback solutions, and detailed troubleshooting documentation. This kind of thorough problem-solving would have taken hours of research manually."

**Before/After**:
- Show the problem (MetaMask missing)
- Show Kiro's debug component
- Demonstrate the working solution

### Segment 5: AWS Deployment Automation (30 seconds)
**Scene**: Infrastructure as Code generation
- **Visual**: Terraform configuration and deployment scripts
- **Demonstration**:
  1. Complete AWS infrastructure setup
  2. Automated deployment scripts
  3. CloudFront CDN configuration
  4. Security and monitoring setup

**Narration**:
> "Finally, Kiro generated complete AWS infrastructure with Terraform, automated deployment scripts, and production-ready security configuration. What typically requires deep AWS expertise became a single command deployment."

**Live Demo**:
- Show the deployed application
- Demonstrate global CDN performance
- Highlight security features

### Closing (30 seconds)
**Scene**: Results summary and impact
- **Visual**: Application overview with metrics
- **Key Statistics**:
  - 78% time reduction (26 hours → 5.5 hours)
  - Zero configuration errors
  - Production-ready from day one
  - Comprehensive documentation generated

**Narration**:
> "The result: a production-ready Web3 application with interactive mapping, wallet connectivity, AWS deployment, and comprehensive documentation - all in just 5.5 hours. Kiro didn't just write code; it served as architect, debugger, DevOps engineer, and technical writer."

## Technical Demonstrations
