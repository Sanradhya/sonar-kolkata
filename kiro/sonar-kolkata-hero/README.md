# Sonar Kolkata - HERO Documentation

## Project Overview

**Sonar Kolkata** is a Web3-enabled React application that combines heritage site exploration with blockchain technology. Built using Kiro AI assistant, this project demonstrates the power of AI-assisted development for creating complex, modern web applications.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Create an interactive map showcasing Kolkata's heritage sites
- Integrate Web3 wallet connectivity for decentralized features
- Build a marketplace for heritage-related digital content
- Deploy to AWS with production-ready infrastructure
- Demonstrate Kiro's capabilities in full-stack development

## 🛠 Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 19.2.0** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui** for modern UI
- **React Leaflet** for interactive maps
- **React Router** for navigation

### Web3 Integration
- **Wagmi** + **RainbowKit** for wallet connectivity
- **Ethers.js** for blockchain interactions
- **Multi-chain support** (Ethereum, Base, Polygon, etc.)

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- **AWS S3** + **CloudFront** for hosting
- **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD (planned)
